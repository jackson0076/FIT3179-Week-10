        <h1>🌐 Australia's connectivity with the internet 🌐 </h1>

        <div class="introduction">

            In today's world, the internet is a vast network that connects the world together, serving as a foundation
            for various tasks and infrastructure growths worldwide. Despite the long-existing history, the internet is
            still a growing field evolving every day. The main focus will be on Australia's internet infrastructure and
            its performance over the past years, which may help others understand where Australia sits in terms of
            performance, and where the country differs in comparison to other countries.

            In comparison to the rest of the world, Australia sits at an average of <b>71.87 Mbps</b> download speed,
            ranking
            it <b>76th</b> in the world.

            The country with the highest average speed is the United Arab Emirates (297.62Mbps), followed by Singapore
            (297.57).

                    As of 2024, mobile internet speeds have become increasingly popular as it allows people to connect
                    to the internet from anywhere using their devices. Compared to many other countries, it seems that
                    Australia performs decently in terms of Mobile speeds, but falls behind in fixed broadband speeds
                    <b>(94.33Mbps)</b> . Prominent countries like Singapore and China outperform Australia, suggesting although Australia's mobile internet infrastructure is still strong compared with many countries, but overall lacks in performance.

                        As of December 2023, the number of connected NBN services heavily outweigh connected non-NBN
                        services, and even some providers such as Optus discontinuing service connections for Non-NBN
                        services. <b>Telstra</b> is by far the most popular with the Australian community due to their
                        high
                        speeds and reliability, and so are preferred by most organisations and households.

                        The most common speed plan in an Australian household is around <b>50Mbps</b>, which is enough
                        for
                        an
                        average family to browse freely each month. However, some households may not be able to afford
                        the plans, or might need a faster speed to accomodate additional house members, so 25Mbps and
                        100Mbps are the next best options.
